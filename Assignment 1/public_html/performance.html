            <a href = "./index.html">Toyota</a> decided to unify all <a href = "./index.html">Toyota</a> Racing, <a href = "./lexus.html">Lexus</a> 
            Racing and other related racing activities under the Gazoo Racing banner. “GAZOO” refers to the word “Garage”, a very intimate place where people work together to improve the smallest details, with the aim 
            of delivering ever-better cars and services for each customer, in each garage. As such, the name embodies the spirit that 
            drives TOYOTA GAZOO Racing.

        <p>
            Toyota Racing Development (TRD), on the other hand, is probably a name most of you are familiar with. UMW Toyota Malaysia 
            have been offering high-spec models like the Hilux and Vios in “TRD Sportivo” bodykits in the past. 
            Toyota Racing Development has been around for decades and decades, but since Gazoo Racing became the focus of 
            Toyota’s motorsport activities, TRD branding has certainly fallen by the wayside.

            It is also to be noted, that these <b>TRD & GR models</b> are not different cars, they are more specced-up, tuned &
            performance oriented regular selling <a href="./vehicles.html">Toyota-Lexus models.</a>

            What makes TRD and GR so great?
