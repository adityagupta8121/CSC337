                <b><i>Lexus</i></b> is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker <a href="./index.html">Toyota</a>. 
                The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars.
                While, there is a tough competition in the market for luxury cars, Lexus remains on the top spot for having best-selling SUVs in it's fleet.
                Most of the Lexus cars, share their platforms and parts with Toyota <a href="./vehicles.html">cars</a>.
            </p>

            <div>
                While <a href="./index.html">Toyota</a> has different performance and motorsport branches like 
                <a href="./performance.html">GR & TRD</a>, Lexus has <b><i>F marque</i></b> but it's not as pronounced as it's a luxury car manufacturer.

            <div>Here are things that help explain why a Lexus is a Lexus, and how it is Toyota-like, i.e., cheap and reliable:</div>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Engaging Driving Dynamics:</b> 
                With tight, responsive steering and precision suspension systems, theyâ€™re fun to drive and will get you to your destination with ease.</li>
            <li><b>Attractive Resale and Maintenance:</b>
                Just like <a href="./index.html">Toyota</a>, Lexus cars are super reliable and easy to own.</li>
            <li><b>Lexus leads the Hybrid Market:</b>
                <a href="./index.html">Toyota</a> has led the hybrid market since its inception, with hybrid sales outnumbering all competitors. 
                According to data, hybrids accounted for 95 percent of all Lexus sold.</li>
            <li><b>Full of firsts!:</b>
                Lexus is the first one to invent and apply features and technologies 
                on mass-production cars and then gets copied by the German rivals.</li>
        </ul>
